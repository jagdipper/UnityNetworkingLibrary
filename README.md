This repository contains `UnityNetworkingLibrary`, a custom networking library designed for Unity projects. It is tailored for multiplayer games and applications, particularly those handling sensitive healthcare data and requiring compliance with standards like HIPAA.

## Features

- **TCP Network Client**: A basic implementation for establishing TCP connections, essential for reliable data transmission.
- **Secure Data Transmission**: Incorporating robust encryption methods to ensure data security.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Designed to handle varying loads with optimal performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with `UnityNetworkingLibrary`, clone this repository and explore the `NetworkClient.cs` file, which demonstrates how to establish a basic TCP connection in Unity.

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer
- Basic understanding of C# and Unity's networking concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/UnityNetworkingLibrary.git
2. Open your Unity project and import the files.
3. Integrate `NetworkClient.cs` into your project as needed.

## Usage

The `NetworkClient` class provides basic methods to connect to a server using TCP and send data:

```csharp
NetworkClient client = new NetworkClient();
client.Connect("hostname", port);
client.SendData("Your message here");

Remember to handle disconnections and data reception as per your project's requirements.
